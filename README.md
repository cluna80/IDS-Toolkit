Firstly, we need to understand the classes and methods needed for this task:

1. NMAP: This class will be responsible for performing network scanning using the NMAP tool. It will have methods for scanning a specific IP or a range of IPs.

2. Sniffer: This class will be responsible for sniffing the network packets. It will have methods to start and stop the sniffing process.

3. IDS_toolkit: This class will be the main class that will use the NMAP and Sniffer classes. It will have methods to start the intrusion detection process and stop it.

4. requirements.txt: This file will contain all the dependencies needed for the project.

Now, let's create the code for each file.

__init__.py
